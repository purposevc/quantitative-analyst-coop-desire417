    "#  Quantitative Analyst Assessment\n",
    "Welcome to the Quantitative Analyst Assessment. To help us get to know you better, please complete the following assessment to your best knowledge and independently. We structure the test to reflect the actual analysis and problems of the Quantitative Analyst role. The right blend of analytical skills, technical skills, capital market knowledge is crucial for this role. The questions cover the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Capital Market\n",
    "- Analytical Thinking\n",
    "- Data Analysis\n",
    "- Data Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this assessment primarily intends to help us find a suitable candidate, the tools and packages used in the test are essential in modern quantitative portfolio management, data science, and machine learning. You will find similar applications outside of finance, such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), and it is beneficial for anyone who wants to start a career in data-related fields. We hope you get something out of this, no matter the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the Python packages and tools are well-documented on the web. If you encounter something new, we will encourage you to do your research. Please do not share this confidential notebook; Purpose Investments reserves all copyrights.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the recruiting purpose, we will contact suitable candidates only for the next step. Enjoy. Have fun!\n",
    "\n",

    "**Value** and **Momentum** are two of the most prevalent factors with plenty of research and application. For the S&P 500 index, you are given the historical prices (dataframe `prices`) and fundamental data (dataframe `fundamentals`) of all the index members. Please programmatically create a strategy to pick 50 stocks within the index, which rebalance quarterly, utilizing the **Value** and **Momentum** factors. Please also provide a brief explanation and put the output in `df_value` and `df_momentum` respectively. Any backtest or statistics that show to justify your strategy is better than the S&P500 will be a plus.\n",
